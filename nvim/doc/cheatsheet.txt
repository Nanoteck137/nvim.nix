TIPS & TRICKS                                                *vim-cheatsheet-tips*

• Most commands can be prefixed with a number to repeat them
  Example: 3dd deletes 3 lines, 5w moves forward 5 words

• Combine operators with motions for powerful editing
  Examples: d3w (delete 3 words), y2j (yank current and 2 lines below)

• Use '.' to repeat your last change - it's incredibly powerful

• Visual mode selection can be combined with any operator
  Example: Select with v, then press d to delete

• Use marks to jump around: ma to set mark 'a', 'a to jump to it

• Use registers for advanced copy/paste: "ayy to yank to register a,
  "ap to paste from register a
